                <h1>Live Betting</h1>
                <p>On some events we offer odds on the outcome of the match-up while the game is being played or â€˜in-progressâ€™.</p>
                <p>Live betting is treated the same as any other bet, although the pricing will reflect what has happened in the game so far.</p>
                <p>For example, in Super Bowl XL, at the start of the second quarter, Seattle led Pittsburgh 3-0. We might offer the following lines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>Pittsburgh -2.5 +100 Over 36.5 -115</div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div>Seattle +2.5 -130 Under 36.5 -115</div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you place a bet on the Seattle Seahawks +2.5 -130, this bet would be graded the same as if it were made before the game began. If Seattle won the game or lost by exactly 1 or 2 points, your wager would win. Alternatively, if you bet on the Pittsburgh Steelers they must win by 3 points or more for your bet to win.</p>

                <h1>Horses Rules</h1>
                <p>
                    Every Horse Wager has an accepted time. In order to have action this accepted time must at least one minute before the published off time listed at www.equibase.com Any Horse wager accepted on or after the off time will be cancelled *. 
                    Example: Churchill Downs race 1 goes off at 12:46 PM. In order for a wager to have action then the accepted time would have to be 12:45 PM or earlier. We reserve the right to cancel any wager due to a ticket being a past post, or any computer malfunction in the closing time of any race. The races are viewable on the internet well after the post time and wagers may be entered. However the accepted time will be after the off time and they will be canceled. Please try to place horse wagers early.
                </p>
                <p>Exception to Rule Above* Due to the increased interest in Triple Crown Races (Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes). We will have a different off time than DRF. The race will be watched live and when the race starts the exact time on our server will be entered as the Off Time. Any customer may check this off time by selecting any straight wager and looking at â€œLines effective: DATE and TIME)â€ as the race starts. Please click Update Lines to refresh the time. Please call or contact your Agent if you have any Questions.</p>
                <p>We do not assume liability for wagers that are unsuccessfully entered before post time.</p>
                <p>Horses are identified by saddlecloth number not by name.</p>
                <p>When you wager on a horse that is coupled with other horses, your wager includes all horses running under that number. If a horse is coupled with others, you receive all horses running as part of the entry. If part of the entry is scratched and the other part of the entry runs, all wagers have action. There is no â€œmust goâ€ action as part of the entry. If one of the entry horses runs, all wagers have action.</p>
                <p>If there are no track payoffs for a certain type of wager, all wagers will be refunded.</p>

                                Straight Bet selected on Ogivly TOP 10 +350, for $100.<br />
                                <br />
                                Scenario #1: Two golfers – including Ogivly – tie for 10th place.<br />
                                <br />
                                The risk amount ($100) is divided by 2 as there are only 2 golfers sharing one same paying position (10th place). In this case, half of the stake ($50) gets paid full odds, and the other half ($50 as well) is lost. $50 on Ogivly +350 wins $175, for a total credit of $225.
                                    <br />
                                A bet on any other golfer for TOP 10 that is not tied in 10th place, but yet a winner, will pay full odds for the whole amount wagered.
                                    <br />
                                <br />
                                Scenario #2: Five golfers – including Ogivly – tie for 10th place.
                                    <br />
                                <br />
                                The risk amount ($100) is divided by the number of competitors involved in the "dead heat" (5 golfers) = $20 (divided stake) and multiplied by the number of paying positions (there is only one paying position as it is the last place in which 5 golfers are tied). The remainder $80 of the risk amount are lost.
                                    <br />
                                The divided stake gets paid full odds of the wager as if originally the bet was only for $20. $20 on Ogivly +350 pays $70 to win, for a total credit of $90. 
                                    <br />
                                A bet on any other golfer for TOP 10 that is not tied in 10th place, but yet a winner, will pay full odds for the whole amount wagered.

                                <br />
                                Scenario #3: Five golfers – including Ogivly – tie for 8th place.
                                    <br />
                                <br />
                                The risk amount ($100) is divided by the number of competitors involved in the "dead heat" (5 golfers) = $20 (divided stake) and multiplied by the number of paying positions (3: 8th, 9th & 10th) = $60. The wager amount to be paid at full odds is $60. The remainder $40 of the risk amount are lost.
                                    <br />
                                $60 on Ogivly + 350 pays $210 to win, for a total credit of $270.
                                    <br />
                                A bet on any other golfer for TOP 10 that is not tied in 8th place, but yet a winner, will pay full odds for the whole amount wagered.

                    <p>
                        Baseball Notes: If a Regular Season game is called or suspended after 4Â½ innings of play the score is determined after the last full inning of play, unless the home team scores to tie or win in the bottom half of the inning, in which case the winner is determined by the score when the game is called. When betting listed pitchers, both pitchers must start in order to have action. In Baseball, a wager on a Run Line or a Total will always be with the Listed Pitchers, therefore if there is a Pitcher change, the wager will be NO ACTION.

                    </li>
                    <li>The result of a game is official after 5 innings of play unless the home team is leading after 4.5 innings. If a Regular Season game is called or suspended, the winner is determined by the score after the last full inning unless the home team scores to tie, or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning, in which case the winner is determined by the score at the time the game is called. Monies will be refunded if the home team ties the game and it is then suspended. Regular Season Games will not carry over to the following day unless otherwise specified.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wagers on Total Runs, Run Lines and Alternate Run Lines will be refunded if a pitcher change occurs prior to both listed pitchers throwing at least one pitch.

Example: Suppose AC Milan lead Juventus 1-0 at half time and the odds on the second half are Juventus -0.5. The -0.5 applies to the second half of play only. Therefore Juventus bettors win if Juventus scores more goals in the second half than AC Milan scores in the second half. AC Milan bettors win if the teams score an equal number of goals in the second half, or if AC Milan scores more goals in the second half than Juventus scores in the second half. The match must reach full time for second half wagers to stand.</li>
                    <li>10. Bets on teams to qualify or to advance to the next round of a competition: Bets are paid out on the referee&acirc;&euro;&trade;s final whistle at the match&acirc;&euro;&trade;s natural conclusion, whether the match is decided in regular time, extra time, or in a penalty shootout. Extra time and penalty shootouts are always included for betting purposes. In a one-leg match all bets have action once the match kicks off. If the referee abandons a one-leg match (for reasons including, but not limited to: crowd disturbances, unplayability of the pitch, or one team not having enough players to continue) bets will be paid based on decisions of the relevant governing body. Bets will stand while the governing body considers the circumstances of the abandonment and determines what remedy is to be taken (including, but no limited to: forfeiture, resumption of play at a later time, or a replay). If a team is disqualified before the match kicks off, all bets are void. If the rules prescribe a replay for a drawn match, all bets stand for the replay. In a two-leg match, all bets have action once the second leg kicks off, provided that the first leg has not been ruled a forfeit. If the first leg is ruled a forfeit, all bets on teams &acirc;&euro;&tilde;to qualify&acirc;&euro;&trade; or &acirc;&euro;&tilde;to advance&acirc;&euro;&trade; are void. If the second leg is abandoned, all bets remain valid and will be paid based on decisions of the relevant governing body.</li>
                    <li>11. Soccer Rules for Live Betting:
                            <br />
                        <ol class="nonum mgT10">
                            <li>1. Live betting: All bets taken while Live Betting is being offered INCLUDE all goals already scored in the match up to the point the bet is struck. Example: Real Madrid lead 2-0 and are currently offered at -3. If Real Madrid win by 4 goals or more, bettors backing Real Madrid -3 win, and bettors backing the opposition at +3 lose. If Real Madrid win by exactly 3 goals, all bets struck at Real Madrid -3 or the opponents +3 are refunded. If Real Madrid win the match by two goals, or win by one goal, or do not win the match, bettors backing Real Madrid -3 lose, and bettors backing the opposition +3 win.</li>
                            <li>2. Unless otherwise specified, Live Betting wagers on the outcome of a match will be decided based on two halves of 45 minutes each and any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages. It does not include periods of extra time nor penalty shootouts.</li>
                            <li>3. Unless otherwise stated at the time of offer, bets on live matches stand if and only if the match reaches full time.</li>
                            <li>4. If a match is suspended before full time is reached, and not completed the same day, Live Betting wagers on the outcome of the match are considered void and all stakes shall be returned.</li>
                            <li>5. Live betting wagers are accepted dependent on upcoming events in the Soccer match. Clients may or may not accept these terms by confirming or not confirming the wager with their password. All Live Betting Soccer wagers are subject to deletion from the account.</li>
                            <li>6. Our Sportsbook reserves the right to cancel any wager made on an obvious &quot;bad&quot; line.</li>
                            <li>7. Our Sportsbook cannot guarantee that odds will be offered at any specific time during the match; odds will not regularly be offered after the 80th minute of play.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>12. Wagers made on a team winning a specific cup or trophy will have action through Extra Time and Penalty Kicks. For example, a bet made on AC Milan to win the Champions League Trophy would have action through Extra Time and Penalty Kicks and would be graded on the result after those added sessions(if they were needed to be played).</li>
                    <li>13. For proposition bets concerning total number of goals on a specific day in a specific league/competition, the exact number of matches must be played on that day and wagers will be decided based on two halves of 45 minutes each and any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages. Goals scored in periods of extra time or penalty shootouts do not count.<br />
                        For example, a prop for total number of goals for 3 English Premiere matches on a Sunday, must have all 3 matches completed for action on that day. If one or more games is not played (or completed) on that Sunday, the wager has no action.</li>
                    <li>14. For proposition bets concerning home vs away goals on a specific day in a specific league/competition, the exact number of matches must be played on that day and wagers will be decided based on two halves of 45 minutes each and any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages. Goals scored in periods of extra time or penalty shootouts do not count.<br />
                        For example, a prop for home vs away goals for 3 English Premiere matches on a Sunday, must have all 3 matches completed for action on that day. If one or more games is not played (or completed) on that Sunday, the wager has no action.</li>
                    <li>15. For proposition bets concerning home vs away goals for a given League or competition on a given day, the team listed on top in a neutral field game (denoted by &quot;(n)&quot;) will be considered the home team.</li>
                    <li>16. Player Proposition:&nbsp;A proposition bet concerning if a player will score, or not score, in a specific match includes regulation time (plus injury time) only. Own goals do not count. For wagers to have action, the player must start the match. Bets on any player who does not start the match will be cancelled.</li>
                    <li>17. Yellow Card Propositions:
                            <br />
                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
                            <li><div>o For grading purposes, only yellow cards are included for Total Yellow Card Propositions. When a player receives a second yellow card (and as a result, a red card), the player will have been shown two yellow cards.</div></li>
                            <li><div>o If a player receives a straight red card, he will not necessarily have been shown a yellow card previously in the match. Therefore, a straight red card is not included in the grading of Total Yellow Card propositions.</div></li>
                            <li><div>o For example, a game with two yellow cards and a straight red card would be graded as two yellow cards; Or, a game with two players with one yellow card each and one player with a red card (as a result of two yellow</div></li>
                            <li><div>o For betting purposes all yellow cards shown to any player count (this includes those playing or sitting on the bench). Any cards shown to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;non-playing&acirc;&euro; staff do not count.</div></li>
                            <li><div>o Yellow cards during periods of extra time are not included. Only Yellow cards shown during regulation time, or any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages, are included.</div></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>Corner Kick Proposition:&nbsp;For grading purposes, Corner Kicks which happen in periods of extra time are not included. Only Corner Kicks which take place during regulation time, or any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages, are included.</p>

                <p>Offsides Proposition:&nbsp;For grading purposes, Offsides which happen in periods of extra time are not included. Only Offsides which take place during regulation time, or any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages, are included.</p>

                <p>Exact Score and Both Teams to Score Propositions:&nbsp;For grading purposes, only goals in regulation time, or any time the referee adds to compensate for injuries and other stoppages, are included.</p>

                <p>Head to Head Matchup Propositions:&nbsp;For grading purposes, wagers will be graded based on the completion of each of the competition&#39;s stages (i.e. qualifying rounds, group stages, quarterfinals, etc.) and not based on who is eliminated first. In other words, if one team is eliminated in the semifinals based on a Tuesday match result and the other team is also eliminated in the semifinals based on a Wednesday match result, wagers would be graded no action. In any match with a forfeit, all wagers will have no action, regardless of how the governing body of that league scores a forfeit. For proposition wagers on which team will score first, only goals in regulation time or any added injury time will count. If there are zero goals in regulation/injury time, then all wagers on this proposition will have no action and be refunded. For halftime/fulltime score propositions, only goals in regulation time or any added injury time will count. If match does not go full time, then all wagers on this proposition will be refunded. For correct score propositions, only goals in regulation time or any added injury time will count. If the score is 0-0 in Full Time, then no goals or exact score of 0-0 will be declared the winner. A Clean Sheet will be defined as a team not allowing a goal in regulation or added injury time only. Any goals allowed in Extra Time or Penalty shootouts will not affect this wager. For &quot;will a team have a clean sheet and win&quot; propositions, the team must have a clean sheet(as defined above) and be ahead at the end of regulation/injury time. If the team is not ahead at the end of regulation/injury time, then the related proposition will be graded NO. Any discipline (yellow card, red card, sending off) that occurs after the whistle that ends regulation time will not count toward related propositions for that match. At times (in the Champion&#39;s League or other major competitions) we may offer the proposition &quot;will both Team A and Team B win on a given day.&quot; Wagers on this proposition will be graded based on Full Time (extra time, and shootouts are not included). If either team does not win in Full Time, then NO bets will be graded as winners and YES bets will lose. For action, both games must reach Full Time. If either game is suspended before full time is reached, and not completed the same day, wagers on the outcome of this proposition are considered void and all stakes shall be returned.</p>

                <strong>General:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>If the start of a round is delayed, or if play during a round is suspended, all pending wagers will remain valid for 48 hours. If the postponement lasts more than 48 hours, all pending wagers will be canceled and the money refunded.</li>
                    <li>Wagers on a golfer who does not play in the tournament are graded as No Action.</li>
                    <li>A golfer is deemed to have played once he or she has teed off. In the event of a player withdrawing after having teed off, wagers on that player will be considered a loss.</li>
                    <li>Wagers will be settled using the official tournament and match results (including final match correct score and individual match betting). This includes a match which finishes early, either by agreement of the players or because of injury.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Outright Betting (Tournament Winner):</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The &quot;Field&quot; includes all players not offered by name.</li>
                    <li>All outright bets are settled on the player winning the trophy. The result of play-offs is taken into account.</li>
                    <li>If a tournament does not go the specified number of completed holes (usually 72) and is shortened by the tournament officials, the leader at the end of the number of holes specified by the officials will be the winner, unless there is no further play or only part of a round completed after a bet has been placed, in which case that bet will be canceled.</li>
                    <li>In the event that two or more golfers are tied for the lead at the end of regulation play, a sudden death playoff is normally used to determine the winner of the tournament. In this case, the winner of the playoff is the winner for betting purposes. All other golfers in the playoff will be graded as second-place finishers.</li>
                    <li>In the event of a tie for a finishing position, the tied position will count; for example, if five players tie for eighth place, all five will be considered to have finished eighth.</li>
                    <li>In some tournaments, tournament officials may have the individuals play a specified number of playoff holes to determine the tournament winner. In this case, the golfer with the lowest score after completing the specified number of holes will be declared the winner, and all other golfers in the playoff will be graded as second-place finishers.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Golf Matchups:</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>In head-to-head matchups, both golfers must tee off in order to have action.</li>
                    <li>Players are paired for betting purposes only. The player with the lower score over the entire tournament is the matchup winner.</li>
                    <li>In 1st Round matchups, the player with the lower score in the 1st round ONLY (usually 18 holes) is the matchup winner</li>
                    <li>Settlement will be on the player achieving the highest placing at the end of the tournament. If the number of rounds played is reduced, as in the case of bad weather, bets stand providing that an official tournament winner is declared.</li>
                    <li>If one player misses the cut, the other player is deemed the winner. If both players miss the cut, the lowest score after the cut has been made will determine the winner.</li>
                    <li>If a player is disqualified or withdraws after starting, either prior to the completion of two rounds or after both players have made the cut, the other player is deemed the winner.</li>
                    <li>If a player is disqualified during either the 3rd or 4th rounds, when the other player in the match bet has already missed the cut, the disqualified player will be considered the winner.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>To Miss/Make The Cut:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>For some tournaments we may offer prices for players to make the cut (take part in the final rounds), or miss the cut (fail to qualify for the final rounds).</div>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Finishing Position of a Named Player:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>In the event of a tie for a finishing position, the tied position will count, eg. a tie with 5 other players for 8th place will count as a finishing position of 8.</div>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ol>
                    <li>The winner will be the player with the lowest score at the end of the tournament (or after the cut if all players miss the cut), playoff included.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Unless otherwise noted, fights must take place within one week of the listed date of the fight or the bout will be graded &quot;no action&quot; and wagers refunded.</li>
                    <li>Venue changes within the same country will not affect the status of pending wagers. Venue changes to a different country will result in a grade of &quot;no action&quot; on all pending wagers.</li>
                    <li>If the number of scheduled rounds in a fight is changed, the following wagers will have action: the fight winner, fighter wins only, and draw options. &quot;fight totals&quot; &amp; &quot;will go / won&#39;t go&quot; will have action if the updated scheduled rounds is more than the total listed on the proposition. Exact round of ending, fighter to win inside distance, win by decision, and goes distance propositions will all be no action if scheduled rounds are changed or misposted.</li>
                    <li>Results will be graded based on the official result at ringside.</li>
                    <li>A result may be revised or altered after initial presentation by the ring announcer. For wagering purposes, results are not official until verified by officials at the fighting venue. Official or unofficial sanctioning body overturns of a fight decision based on appeal, suspension, lawsuit, drug testing result, or any other fighter sanction will not be recognized for wagering purposes.</li>
                    <li>A wager on a fighter &quot;Inside Distance&quot; wins if the selected fighter wins by KO, TKO, DQ, submission, or any other form of stoppage.</li>
                    <li>A wager on a fighter to win by &quot;KO/TKO&quot; wins only if the fighter wins by KO, TKO or corner stoppage. A win by submission is not considered a KO/TKO in MMA.</li>
                    <li>When a &quot;draw&quot; occurs, wagers on both fighters &quot;to win&quot; are refunded.</li>
                    <li>Other proposition wagers are graded according to their specific wording.</li>
                    <li>An &quot;If Wins Only&quot; wager loses when a fight ends in a draw.</li>
                    <li>Any fight that is deemed &quot;no contest&quot; will have all wagers refunded.</li>
                    <li>A total listed on a fight represents the total number of completed rounds. The halfway point of a round is at exactly two minutes and thirty seconds into a five minute round. Thus, 2&Acirc;&frac12; rounds would be two minutes and thirty seconds of the 3rd round.</li>
                    <li>If an over/under total lands on the exact half round total in a fight, the wager will be a push. If the phrase &quot;Fight goes 2:30 round X&quot;, and the fight ends at exactly that second of that round, then &quot;Fight goes&quot; will be graded the winner.</li>
                    <li>In round distance wagering, if a fighter fails to answer the bell for the start of any round, the fight officially ended in the last round fought.</li>
                    <li>In total wagering, if a fighter does not answer the bell to start a round where the fight has gone the exact distance listed on the total, the UNDER is the winner.</li>
                    <li>For wagers that state &quot;will a fighter win in round x&quot;, that fighter must finish the fight in round x to win the prop. For example, if you bet YES for &quot;Mark Coleman to win in round 3&quot;, then the fight must be stopped in Coleman&#39;s favor in round 3 for yes to be considered the winner. The only exception is if a fighter does not answer the bell for a round. Then the fight officially ended in the last round fought.</li>
